    "the [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) module - includes a high-level, object oriented, API for working with concurrency from Python. Thread objects run concurrently within the same process and share memory with other thread objects. Using threads is an easy way to scale for tasks that are more I/O bound than CPU bound. The python threading module is used to manage the execution of threads within a process. It allows a program to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process space.\n",

Because the `Condition` uses a `Lock`, it can be tied to a shared resource, allowing multiple threads to wait for the resource to be updated. In this example, the `consumer()` threads wait for the `Condition` to be set before continuing. The `producer()` thread is responsible for setting the condition and notifying the other threads that they can continue."
